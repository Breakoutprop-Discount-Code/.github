## 🚀 What is Breakout Prop?

Breakout Prop is a US-founded, crypto-native proprietary trading firm established in 2023 and built from the ground up for one specific purpose — giving serious cryptocurrency traders access to funded capital on real, tier-one exchange infrastructure without the simulated fills, synthetic pricing, and artificial execution environments that underpin most CFD-based prop firms. Since its launch, Breakout has issued over 20,000 funded accounts, processed every single payout without delay across all market conditions, and built a Trustpilot rating of 4.9 out of 5 from over 170 verified reviews — a record the firm publicly highlights as evidence of operational reliability rather than marketing language.

What separates Breakout from the broader prop trading landscape is the execution environment. Traders access over 100 cryptocurrency assets — including perpetual futures on major and altcoin pairs — with liquidity sourced directly from tier-one centralised exchanges, giving fills, spreads, and order book depth that match what any professional crypto trader would experience trading on the open market. The proprietary Breakout Terminal includes TradingView and AdvancedCharts integration, real-time order book visibility, advanced order types, one-click execution, and mobile trading on iOS and Android — all within a single platform built specifically for the firm's evaluation and funded account ecosystem. Evaluations are available in both one-step and two-step formats with no time limits, account sizes from $5,000 to $100,000 and a scaling path to $2,000,000, fees from $55 to $999 depending on account size and format, and a profit split of up to 90% with on-demand daily payouts in USDC via the ERC-20 network — processed from a $50 minimum withdrawal threshold with no withdrawal fees.

## 💼 Why Choose Breakout Prop Over Other Prop Firms?

Breakout Prop has built a reputation as one of the most execution-transparent, payout-reliable, and rule-clear crypto prop firms operating in 2026. Here is what sets it apart:

- **Tier-one centralised exchange liquidity — not simulated fills** — every position opened on Breakout connects to real order book depth from tier-one crypto exchanges, meaning fills, slippage, and execution quality are identical to what a professional trader experiences trading on the open market; there is no internal matching engine, no synthetic pricing, and no artificial spread environment masking the true cost of execution
- **No time limits on 1-Step or 2-Step evaluations** — traders take as long as they need to hit their profit target without any evaluation expiry, monthly billing cycle forcing a restart, or pressure to overtrade a strategy that needs time to play out across different market conditions; the evaluation clock simply does not exist at Breakout
- **No consistency rules — no hidden conditions** — Breakout explicitly operates with no consistency rule, no minimum profitable day requirement, and no restriction on how profits are distributed across trading days; the only rules are the profit target and the drawdown limits, both of which are clearly published for every account size before purchase
- **Up to 90% profit split with no profit caps** — funded traders keep up to 90% of every dollar they generate with no cap on total earnings, no maximum monthly profit ceiling, and no percentage withheld beyond the documented split; the standard split is 80% with a purchasable upgrade option to 90% available on both 1-Step and 2-Step accounts
- **On-demand daily USDC payouts from a $50 minimum** — funded traders can request a payout on any trading day once a minimum $50 threshold is reached after the Performance Split deduction, with no calendar restriction, no bi-weekly window, and no specific payout day requirement; for Breakout Account holders, payouts are available daily with processing completed and USDC delivered via ERC-20 as soon as the request is approved
- **20,000+ funded accounts issued with zero payout delays** — Breakout publicly documents that every payout across its 20,000+ funded account history has been processed without delay in all market conditions, a claim backed by Trustpilot reviews referencing specific payout amounts processed the same day as submission, including individual withdrawals of $7,000 and above confirmed within 24 hours
- **1-Step evaluation for fast-track funding** — the 1-Step challenge requires hitting a single 10% profit target with a 4% to 5% maximum daily loss and a 6% total drawdown limit, with no second phase, no verification stage, and no additional hurdle between passing and receiving a funded account; for a $25,000 account that means a $2,500 profit target with a $1,000 to $1,250 daily loss ceiling and a $1,500 total drawdown buffer
- **2-Step evaluation for traders who want more drawdown room** — the 2-Step format splits the profit target across two phases with an 8% maximum total drawdown limit, giving traders who prefer a more gradual evaluation process a larger risk buffer in exchange for demonstrating consistency across two separate performance windows rather than one
- **Scaling path to $2,000,000 in funded capital** — consistent funded account performers can scale their allocation progressively up to $2,000,000 through Breakout's documented scaling plan, making it one of the few crypto prop firms with a verifiable seven-figure capital allocation pathway available to individual traders
- **News trading fully permitted** — high-impact economic events including NFP, CPI, FOMC, and major crypto-specific announcements are freely tradeable on all Breakout accounts provided exchange liquidity and data feeds are intact, with no mandatory flat-position windows or pre-event buffer restrictions that limit strategy execution around macro events
- **100+ crypto assets across perpetual futures** — trade major coins, altcoins, and perpetual futures pairs with leverage of up to 5:1 on Bitcoin and Ethereum and 2:1 on altcoins, giving traders meaningful position sizing flexibility within a risk framework calibrated for the natural volatility of the cryptocurrency markets
- **Breakout Terminal with TradingView integration** — the proprietary platform includes TradingView and AdvancedCharts directly built in alongside real-time order book depth, advanced order types including stop-limit and trailing stops, one-click execution, comprehensive risk management dashboards, and iOS and Android mobile apps — a complete professional trading environment requiring no third-party platform subscriptions or external charting tools
- **Breach insurance available** — traders who breach a funded account can purchase breach insurance in advance, which grants a 7-day window post-breach to request any earned profits before the account is closed, protecting earnings from being forfeited due to a single adverse session at the end of an otherwise profitable trading period
- **4.9 out of 5 Trustpilot rating from 170+ verified reviews** — traders consistently highlight same-day USDC payouts, transparent and consistently enforced rule structures, responsive customer support, and the quality of the Breakout Terminal execution environment as standout qualities that distinguish the firm from competing crypto prop firms

## 🔓 Reduce Your Startup Cost with INVEST

Breakout Prop evaluation fees start from just $55 for a $5,000 two-step account and scale up to $999 for the largest account sizes — already among the most competitively structured fee ranges in the crypto prop trading space relative to the capital allocation, execution quality, and payout reliability on offer. With the discount code **INVEST**, you reduce that already accessible upfront cost by a further 2%, lowering the financial barrier to entering a real-exchange-execution crypto prop environment where every fill is backed by tier-one exchange liquidity, every payout is processed in USDC without delay, and the scaling path reaches $2,000,000 for traders who build a consistent funded track record.

Lower upfront cost means a reduced financial barrier to entry, a cleaner mindset approaching the no-time-limit evaluation at your natural pace, and more of your capital preserved for the disciplined risk management that Breakout's rule structure is designed to reward with on-demand daily USDC payouts and a profit split that reaches 90%.

## 🙌 Who Should Use This Code?

- Crypto traders who want real tier-one exchange liquidity behind every fill rather than a simulated CFD environment — Breakout's execution connects directly to centralised exchange order books with verifiable fills and real-time depth of market
- Traders who want on-demand daily payouts with no calendar restrictions — the $50 minimum withdrawal threshold, zero withdrawal fees, and USDC processing via ERC-20 give crypto-native traders the fastest and most flexible access to their earnings available at any funded trading firm in 2026
- Traders building toward large capital allocations — the scaling path to $2,000,000 is one of the few documented seven-figure funded account pathways in the crypto prop space, available to any consistent performer who builds a track record from a $5,000 starting account
- Traders who need a firm with no consistency rules and no hidden conditions — the profit target and drawdown limits are the only rules at Breakout; no minimum profitable day requirement, no single-day profit percentage cap, and no restriction on how earnings are distributed across the trading session or evaluation window
- News and macro traders who want full freedom to trade around high-impact events — Breakout explicitly permits trading through all major economic releases and crypto-specific announcements with no pre-event restriction of any kind
- Budget-conscious traders who want to reduce their upfront evaluation cost on a firm with a 4.9 out of 5 Trustpilot rating, 20,000+ funded accounts issued, and zero payout delays on record across all market conditions since launch
